# Chapter 1

- Graph Theory: To critically evaluate methods that tend to yield efficient algorithms. (Exam)

## Algorithms

- Algorithm is a sequence of clear instructions (a series of instructions) to solve a problem which requires an input in a finite amount of time to get an output. Algorithm must be specified every step correctly and completely for the computer to understand it in an efficient way.

- Computational problem specifies an input-output relationship. Problems could be anything in any forms.

- Algorithmic contains Input which is to get information, Storage to store information, Process involves Arithmetic, Repeat instructions, or Branch Conditions, Output to display or give information.

- Characteristics of Algorithm includes well-defined inputs and outputs, clear and umambiguous, finiteness, feasible, and language independent.
