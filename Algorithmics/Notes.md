# Chapter 1

- Graph Theory: To critically evaluate methods that tend to yield efficient algorithms. (Exam)

## Algorithms

- Algorithm is a sequence of clear instructions to solve a problem which requires an input in a finite amount of time to get an output. Algorithm must be specified every step correctly and completely for the computer to understand it in an efficient way.

- Computational problem specifies an input-output relationship.
